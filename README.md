# DataScienceFinal
My Final for Dr. Ransom's DScourseS21

This project looks to see which players statistics early in their career can predict future earnings once they reach common arbitration years.

To recreate the results of my experiment, and to create the tables and graphics available in please run the R Script 'HMCCANS_Final_Code.R' This will output all of the data and graphics we've created.
